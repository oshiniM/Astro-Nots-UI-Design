## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** module, aiming to improve the usability of an existing website by identifying user interface issues and redesigning it for a better user experience. We chose the [Historian of the Future](https://www.historianofthefuturex.com/) website, which had several UI challenges. The redesigned pages were created using **Figma** and focus on enhanced navigation, better layout, and consistency.

## Methodology

Our approach to this project followed these steps:
**User Research**: We conducted contextual inquiries with relevant users to gather feedback on the current website.
**Identifying Issues**: Key usability problems were identified, such as poor navigation, inconsistent layouts, and difficulty in finding content.
**Wireframing and Prototyping**: Using Figma, we created multiple wireframe designs for each page and selected the best options for high-fidelity prototypes.
**User Testing**: We tested the redesigned pages with users to ensure the usability issues were resolved.
